<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Research Aims</h4>
<ul>
<li>If evaluating a specific ICT intervention → <strong>PICO</strong></li>
<li>If exploring experiences or perceptions → <strong>SPIDER / PICo</strong></li>
<li>If analyzing context or mechanisms → <strong>CIMO</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Nature of the ICT Project</h4>
<ul>
<li>Technology Development → Structured models like PICO</li>
<li>Implementation Studies → CIMO</li>

</div>

<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Alignment with SDGs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Health impact measurement (SDG 3) → PICO</li>
<li>Education transformation (SDG 4) → PICo / SPIDER</li>

</ul>
</div>

</div>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>
<div class="example-box">
When applying a chosen framework, clearly define each component based on the ICT project's 
scope and SDG alignment. For example, in PICO, precisely define the target population, 
the ICT intervention, the comparison condition, and the measurable outcomes linked to 
the specific Sustainable Development Goal.
</div>

<h2>Consideration of Research Methodology</h2>
<p>
The selected framework must align with the overall research methodology:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualitative methodologies</strong> → SPIDER, PICo</li>
<li><strong>Quantitative methodologies</strong> → PICO</li>
<li><strong>Mixed-methods approaches</strong> → SPIDER or CIMO</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ensuring methodological alignment strengthens the rigor, coherence, and validity of the 
research design, particularly in ICT projects aimed at addressing Sustainable Development Goals.

                <h5>How to Identify Important Keywords, Terms, or Synonyms</h5>
                <p>
                    To develop a protocol, you need to collect a list of terms that you will use to retrieve relevant studies during the search process. Remember that authors may use different words to describe a search concept, so you need to collate a list of alternative words and synonyms. If you fail to include all the relevant terms in the search, you may miss out on appropriate studies.
                </p>

                        <h5>Methods and Tools to Identify Keywords and Synonyms</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                            <strong>Brainstorming:</strong> List potential alternative terms or synonyms for the search concepts. Think about different words, phrases, and jargon that may be used in the field. Perform a simple preliminary search on your main concepts – titles, abstracts, and keywords of alternative terms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <strong>Identify Subject-Specific Terms:</strong> Use textbooks, lecture notes, encyclopedias, and dictionaries to find relevant terms.

  <h3>What is Grey Literature?</h3>

  <p>
    Grey literature refers to research and information produced outside of traditional academic 
    or commercial publishing channels, such as government reports, working papers, theses, 
    and conference proceedings. It is often unpublished or informally published, making it 
    harder to locate. However, it provides current, in-depth, and specialized data that may 
    not be available in peer-reviewed journals.
  </p>

  <h4>Assessing Grey Literature</h4>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Source and Authorship</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Publication Type</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Methodology</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Results</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Relevance</strong></li>
